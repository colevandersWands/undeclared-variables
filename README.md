# Undeclared Variables



---

## Learning Objectives

in sloppy mode
* assigning a value to an undeclared variable will automatically declare that variable 
* variables declared by assignment have lexical scoping like "var", but are not hoisted (ie. can only be used after they have been assigned)
* attempting to read from an undeclared variable will throw an error

in strict mode
* anything involving an undeclared variable will throw an error
